    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Understanding player behaviour is essential when running a game to maintain the server and increase its audience. Thus, game studios record player data to understand, effectively communicate and retain players. A UBC CS research group led by Professor Frank Wood set up a MineCraft server and recorded players’ in-game actions and other demographic data to further improve their player attraction. The collected data can then be further analyzed to target non-subscribers to their newsletter, and gain an understanding of who is likely to stay in communication with the server project. However, not all players choose to subscribe, even some who are very active on the platform. Finding out which users are more or less likely to subscribe can help developers design better promotional strategies and increase overall subscription rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question\n",
    "The question we aimed to answer is <br>**“Can we predict whether or not someone will subscribe to the newsletter based on how much they've played in Plaicraft (`played_hours`) and self-reported Minecraft experience? (`experience`)”**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "The datasets given by the CS research group were collected from players engaging with the Plaicraft server over a defined period. "

    "**Discussion:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "Using a k-nn classification model maximizing for precision, we obtained a model with an optimal k (2 nearest neighbours) and 79% precision value. After splitting the data, we first created a cross-validation k-tuning model to evaluate accuracy with k. Not only was this model redundant, as it was most accurate when we predicted \"TRUE\" for every single observation, but it also failed to capture the important aspects of the inquiry question. We figured developpers would be most interested in non-subscribers, so they could figure out why people are not subscribing and offer subscribtion incentives that would cater to non-subscribers in efforts to get as many people subscribed as possible. Thus, we felt it made sense for our model to sophistocatedly predict which people were not subscribed, and we chose precision as the primary metric we would optimize for. **A high precision ensures that when the model predicts someone as a non-subscriber, it is likely correct, minimizing misclassification.** After trying multiple ks, we produced precision and recall values in a data frame and selected the k with the highest precision. **Although precision was our primary metric, we monitored recall to ensure the model was not overly conservative. The recall remained within a reasonable range, suggesting a balanced performance.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**While we have obtained some useful findings, we have also identified user behavioral issues that cannot be fully explained by the existing data and deserve further research.** A result of 79% is reasonable, and roughly what we could expect since our classes were so imbalanced. Considering it is significantly more than 50%, this data is useful to the developpers, as they can successfully predict 4 of 5 non-subscribers based on how much they've played and use that data to learn about which people do not subscribe. From our first visualization (our predictions mapped), we see that the biggest cluster of predicted non-subscribers were those who had played very few hours in PlaiCraft, regardless of MineCraft experience. This is a reasonable assumption to make; those who have invested very little of their time into this project are least likely to subscribe, irrespective of their passion for MineCraft. **While `played_hours` was the most predictive feature, we also included variable `experience`. `experience` contributed marginally to the model’s performance but was not the primary driver of prediction accuracy.** What is more interesting, however, is the second cluster of non-subscribers at the high end of hours played in PlaiCraft. For these players, there is no reason why they should not have subscribed, and further efforts to figure out why they have not subscribed would make for impactful marketing research. This is likely the biggest impact of our model; we've predicted a cluster of high-commitment non-subscribers, and this logical discrepancy demands more research. Perhaps there are other factors at play; maybe these players are very young and won't receive emails, or perhaps their hours count is unusually high because they leave the game on in the background. These hypotheses could lead to new data analysis that seeks to unpack exclusively that cluster and explain it. **This model can be integrated into user engagement strategies, flagging high-risk non-subscribers early and allowing targeted incentives or follow-up communications.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, although our results lead to some interesting questions, they are hampered by the size and content of the data available. We only have 196 observations with 7 metrics being tracked, leading to a small and thus perhaps more inaccurate testing set. We also can't perform analysis on metrics like \"How often do they check their email\" or \"How many other newsletters are they subscribed to,\" which means our results must be produced strictly by what we have accessible. Although our model is clearly functional, 79% is not overly powerful, and indeed, the cluster of high-commitment non-subscribers contains two fewer observations than our model suggests. While it is worth investigating, we need more data and a better model before we can pursue other questions related exclusively to that cluster.  \n",
    "**In summation, here are a few ways to improve the performance of our model:**  \n",
    "1. **Richer behavioral data** <br>\n",
    "   Examples: Past subscription behavior in similar games, device type or platform, in-game purchase history...  \n",
    "2. **Demographic information** <br>\n",
    "   Examples: Language spoken  \n",
    "3. **Larger and more diverse dataset** <br> \n",
    "The current dataset contains only 196 observations, which may limit the generalizability and reliability of our findings. Future efforts may focus on inviting more players to PlaiCraft or collecting data over a longer period of time. Larger datasets allow for more accurate modeling, better cross-validation, and may reveal patterns not visible in small samples."
